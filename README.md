# Optimized-Classifiers
Classification of a private corpus with 50000 instances and 48 features into 11 classes was done using optimized K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm(used matrix-based operations to reduce the run time), K-Means algorithm and Random Forest from scratch. Further implemented ensemble model with Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and KNN using sklearn library.
